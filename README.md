**Designing a Relational Database and Creating an Entity Relationship. Learning how to Create and Manipulate MySQL Databases with Python**.

I have used the article created by @thecraigd Craig Dickson to learn how to build my own Relational Database in MySQL using Python. My Relationl Database is for Rental Accommodation platforms like Airbnb.com and Booking.com. I have created five tables (Hosts, Cleaners, Guests, Reservation, Takes_Apartment) and I have populated each table with randomly generated data. I have used Excel in an xls format in order to create my tables and import readily available data into Python. 
My project consists of 7 separate files (5 of which are for each of the table) These are split into creating the table SQL variable and populating the table SQL variables. 
Remaining two python files are the driver code and the database_query file.
